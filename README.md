An exercise in thinking through problems with C# in a Dungeons and Dragons setting. This involves a Wizard class and getting all the spells for their class.

This app gets all the spells from the D&D 5e Player's Handbook from FightClub5EXML 
Feel free to try it with a different source in that github's listing,
such as Xanathar's Guide To Everything!

NOTE: You'll need to go to the MagicSources:GetDataSource() function and swap out the path
to your locally downloaded `spells-phb.xml` that you downloaded from
https://github.com/kinkofer/FightClub5eXML/blob/main/Sources/PlayersHandbook/spells-phb.xml
- For Mac: `/Users/<your username>/Downloads/spells-phb.xml`
- For Windows (roughly): `C:/Users/<your username>/Downloads/spells-phb.xml`
